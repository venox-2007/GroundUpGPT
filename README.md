GroundUpGPT is an educational and engineering project dedicated to designing, implementing, training, evaluating, and deploying a small autoregressive, decoder-only Transformer language model completely from scratch using Python and PyTorch.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict First-Principles Engineering Rule**: This project is **not** a chatbot wrapper, API consumer, or fine-tuning exercise of existing pretrained weights (such as GPT-2, LLaMA, or Mistral). All components—including tokenization, positional embeddings, multi-head causal self-attention, feed-forward networks, layer normalization, residual pathways, and autoregressive generation loops—are implemented directly from fundamental tensor mathematics and PyTorch automatic differentiation.

## Project Overview

Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) often feel like opaque "black boxes" wrapped in complex abstraction frameworks. The mission of GroundUpGPT is to demystify every layer of the modern Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) paradigm by building a fully operational, small-scale language model entirely from the ground up.

By implementing each operation explicitly:
- We explore the exact linear algebra and probability mechanics governing token generation.
- We observe the dynamics of training loss, gradient flow, learning rate schedules, and cross-entropy optimization.
- We establish a transparent, mathematically sound codebase suitable for technical interviews, machine learning portfolios, and advanced study.

## Learning & Engineering Objectives

1. **Internal Mechanistic Understanding**:
   - Master autoregressive language modeling and causal masking principles.
   - Implement scaled dot-product attention and multi-head self-attention mechanics.
   - Understand residual streams, pre-normalization (LayerNorm / RMSNorm), and nonlinear activations.
   - Construct a custom tokenization and batching pipeline with efficient tensor padding and truncation.
   - Implement temperature scaling, top-$k$, and top-$p$ (nucleus) sampling for generation.

2. **Rigorous AI/ML Software Engineering**:
   - Write modular, cleanly decoupled PyTorch code with strict type annotations.
   - Develop automated unit test suites (`pytest`) verifying tensor shapes, attention masking properties, and gradient propagation.
   - Maintain strict reproducibility with deterministic seeding across PyTorch, NumPy, and CUDA.
   - Adhere to a disciplined Git workflow with verified, single-step commits.

## Hardware Target & Constraints

All architectural design choices and training configurations are engineered specifically around a personal Windows development workstation:

| Component | Specification | Constraints & Engineering Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU | **6 GB VRAM**, Ampere Architecture (Compute Capability 8.6) |
| **CPU** | Intel Core i5-13450HX (14 cores, 20 threads) | Fast data preprocessing, tokenization, and DataLoader workers |
| **RAM** | 16 GB DDR5 | In-memory dataset caching and token array management |
| **Storage** | 512 GB NVMe SSD | High I/O throughput for tokenized binary shards |
| **OS** | Windows 11 (64-bit) | PowerShell / cmd native environment |

### VRAM Budgeting & Optimization Strategy
With **6 GB of VRAM**, unconstrained training can easily lead to Out-Of-Memory (OOM) runtime errors. To guarantee reliable convergence on local hardware:
- Model parameter count is targeted at **~5 million parameters**.
- Context block sizes will be budgeted between 256 and 512 tokens.
- Training will leverage mixed-precision (`torch.amp.autocast`) and gradient accumulation to simulate larger effective batch sizes without exceeding memory headroom.

| **Vocabulary Size ($V$)** | ~4,096 to 8,192 tokens (custom BPE or byte-level) |
| **Context Length ($T$)** | 256 – 512 tokens |
| **Hidden Dimension ($d_{model}$)** | 256 – 384 |
| **Number of Layers ($N$)** | 6 – 8 Transformer blocks |
| **Attention Heads ($H$)** | 4 – 8 (Head dimension $d_k = d_{model} / H$) |
| **Feed-Forward Dimension ($d_{ff}$)** | $4 \times d_{model}$ (1024 – 1536) |
| **Normalization** | Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) or RMSNorm |
